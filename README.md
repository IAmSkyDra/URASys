# Agentic HCMUT University Admission chatbot

Hi ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the official repository for our **Agentic HCMUT University Admission Chatbot**!  

This project aims to build an intelligent, agentic chatbot to assist prospective students with information about Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT). The chatbot can answer questions regarding admission requirements, academic programs, campus facilities, application procedures, scholarships, and other university-related inquiries. By leveraging advanced NLP and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technologies, our system provides accurate and helpful responses based on the university's official documentation and data.

**Features** âœ¨
- **Accurate Information Retrieval**: Answers questions using verified university data and documents
- **Vietnamese Language Support**: Optimized for both Vietnamese and English queries
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Maintains conversation context for more natural interactions
- **Semantic Search**: Uses advanced embedding techniques to understand question intent
- **Agentic Capabilities**: Can reason through complex multi-step questions about admissions

The system architecture is implemented based on paper [URAG: Implementing a Unified Hybrid RAG for Precise Answers in University Admission Chatbots â€“ A Case Study at HCMUT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16276)
